## Project1: TCP-based client and server
The client will send a line of text (i.e., a string ending with “\n”) to the server over TCP and the server will echo
that line of text back to the client over TCP as a response. 

## Project2: UDP-based TFTP server
This is a simplified file transfer server that supports reliable data transmission over UDP that builds up the 
practical skills necessary to implement a networked application from a protocol specification. 

## Project3: UDP-based PING client
The functionality provided by your client will emulate some of the standard ping utility functionality available in 
modern operating systems, except that it will use UDP rather than raw IP sockets.
